This simple JavaScript snippet is meant to hide YouTube thumbnails and the comments section to provide a cleaner viewing experience :)
To use the code, copy and paste the code in `newstyle.js` in the browser console.  

For a persistent change, use the `hide-thumnbail-extension`. Once installed, the extension will automatically hide thumbnails and comments on YouTube whenever you visit the site.
